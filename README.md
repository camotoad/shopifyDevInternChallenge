# Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Winter 2022

## Getting started
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies

After all the dependencies are installed, 
navigate to ImgRepo/__init__.py and change the secret key to any secret key you'd like. Alternatively, you can create an environment variable named "SK_FlaskBlog" and not have to change any files.

## Running the app
you can run `run.py` and connect to localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on your browser

Functionalities:
* See images
* Upload image
* Search by title and/or tags
* Delete


Due to the lack of time I could not make all the styling I'd like or use a better database.
